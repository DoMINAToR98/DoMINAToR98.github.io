Computer Science Graduate from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University(GGSIPU), Delhi. 

Currently, I am:
1. Finding bugs at [Synack](https://www.synack.com/red-team/). 
2. Preparing for OSCP at [Hack the Box Labs](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/63505).
3. Trying to automate as much as I can using my naive scripting skills. 

*A pdf version of my resume is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ncmk_Zh4GboykN-rWs0bRe9GphLkH5k/view?usp=sharing)*
