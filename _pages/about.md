I am a Final year student pursuing Bachelor's in Computer Science at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi. 

Currently, I am working on:
1. Internshala Ethical Hacking coursework as a Remote TA. 
2. Automating the recon process with push-notifications while hunting for web-app related issues. 
3. Preparing for OSCP at [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/63505)

I am actively looking for full-time opportunities (interested in remote jobs as well) starting August 2020 in the Cybersecurity domain.
